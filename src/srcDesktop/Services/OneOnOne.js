          All services are provided one-on-one by myself in an appropriate
          treatment setting, either in my clinic or in the patientâ€™s home or
          other venue. Most patients can benefit from hour-long appointments,
          and so my schedule is optimized for 60 minute sessions, but can be
          modified to allow for shorter or longer visits depending upon patient
          needs.
